I was first introduced to reading- as a hobby to enjoy and engage in- in the late 2000s, as is the case for many people, through the fantastic Harry Potter books. Since then, with the aid of praiseworthy enterprises such as [JustBooks](https://justbooks.in/), I've attempted to sustain this habit which has both shaped my perspective and given me immense pleasure. Below, I've listed out a few books that I thoroughly enjoyed reading. Books that I read over a decade ago. Books the stories of which lurk in the forgotten recesses of my mind but burst forth in full color at the slightest provocation and paint a dazzling and alluring picture, replete with the sight, sound and smell of a time past. Consequently, a number of these books are for young readers. However, I have since moved towards more "serious" reading. I do hope you have had the pleasure of enjoying at least a few of these books and if you have any recommendations, I'm all ears! Enjoy!
