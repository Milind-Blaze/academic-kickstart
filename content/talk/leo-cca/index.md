summary: "Modifying TCP Reno for LEO satellite networks and implementing Copa 
  on Hypatia"
abstract: "LEO satellite networks are rapidly growing with the rise of Starlink,
Amazon Kuiper and Telesat. Hypatia allows us to study these networks with modules
that simulate satellite movement, routing and simulate packet flow using ns-3. In
this work, we modify TCP Reno to utilize the physical distance between ground
stations to achieve greater fairness when different flows compete. We also 
integrate Copa into Hypatia's ns-3 modules and evaluate its performance."
