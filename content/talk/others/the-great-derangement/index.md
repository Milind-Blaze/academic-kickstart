summary:
abstract: Amitav Ghosh's book _The Great Derangement_ treats with great literary fervour the pressing issue of climate change. Analyzed through the lens of art and literature, climate change is presented as an elusive problem that fails to find representation in "serious" fiction. Further, the book also acknowledges the centrality of Asia to the discussions surrounding climate justice and a fossil fuel based economy especially in the light of the colonial pasts of some of the most populous nations in the world. Amitav Ghosh also delves into the intricacies of the politics of climate change- the considerations, the challenges and the results. This talk provides a brief overview of some of the key ideas presented in the book.
