abstract: 5G technology is poised to bring about a wave of changes in the near future. An integral step in the process of developing 5G systems is performing extensive simulations to verify the efficacy of algorithms before they are implemented on hardware. This talk presents the theoretical framework and design parameters associated with the simulation of an end to end communication system adhering to 5G NR specifications. Particular emphasis is laid on the examination of several channel estimation and equalization techniques which provide adequate performance- measured using bit error rate at a given signal to noise ratio- in the case of a multipath fading channel. In this talk, only results for 64 QAM data with a code rate of 873/1024 in the single user, SISO case are discussed. Further, only single symbol DMRS of configuration type 1 is used. Several important directions of future work are also highlighted.
