At the Indigenous 5G Testbed at IIT Madras I have worked on several projects of which the following are of some significance. 



- [Receiver design and implementation for the Indigenous 5G Testbed](../5g-receiver)
- [Half-duplex system design using USRP N321](../5g-half-duplex)
- [MIMO channel estimation using PDSCH DMRS](../5g-dmrs)
