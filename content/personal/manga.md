Books aside, I also enjoy reading manga (manhwa being the Korean version). I have found these stories full of mirth and hope, action and intrigue, heartbreak and anguish to be surprisingly immersive owing in part to their unique storytelling and in part to their often stunning art. While I am always open to new recommendations, in the past I have enjoyed reading the action packed Naruto and Bleach series, the heartwarming Koe no Katachi and Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso and watching mainstream anime like Kimi no Na Wa.
