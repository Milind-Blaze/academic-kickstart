I am an avid sports enthusiast and love playing badminton, table tennis and soccer and have trained seriously for the former two sports. I also __love__ watching badminton, tennis, soccer, basketball and table tennis and revel in the timeless rivalries that have defined these sports in this era! The fluidity and elegance of these sports simply takes my breath away!
