Of the many facets of existence that I hold dear, there is none I cherish more than the power to create. Just as the books that I have read through the years have moved me, I aspire to write stories that move. However, I am still a fledgling writer with few pieces to my name. Here are some pieces that I've written in the recent past- I sincerely hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoyed writing them!
