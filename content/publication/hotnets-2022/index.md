abstract: "Decentralized cellular networks have emerged to increase network accessibility by distributing infrastructure ownership over independent entities. Unlike the centralized setting, these architectures can allow users to connect to any untrusted base station without prior subscription. However, verification of the service is necessary in the absence of trust for commensurate payments by the user. Further, any method of verification must be non-intrusive and reliably agreed upon by the involved parties. To this end, we describe two-sided measurements where both the users and the providers independently assess the cellular service. We find that reconciling measurements from different layers of the cellular stack for a diverse set of matching observations is challenging but not impossible. Hence, new use cases such as a decentralized slicing marketplace, and contract-free roaming can be enabled by two-sided measurements. We envision applying two-sided measurements to real-time, on-demand network slicing and present an architecture that is capable of offering, as well as verifying, such slices in a scalable manner."
