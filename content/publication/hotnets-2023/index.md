abstract: "Interactive networked applications require high through-
put, low latency, and high reliability from the network to pro-
vide a seamless user experience. While meeting these three
requirements simultaneously is difficult, there has been an
emergence of heterogeneous virtual channels (HVCs) which
support some subset of them at the expense of the others. For
instance, URLLC sacrifices throughput to achieve low latency
and reliability in 5G NR, and Wi-Fi 7 and other novel Internet
architectures provide similar disparate types of service. Prior
work either focuses on aggregating the bandwidth of these
channels whilst neglecting their unique properties or fails to
generalize in the sense of achieving high performance across
different applications and channels. To utilize HVCs to their
fullest, we argue that there are challenges and opportunities
across the network, transport and application layers, and
the application-transport interface of the network stack. In
this work, we explore the trade-offs of these architectural
choices in the context of web browsing and real-time video,
and identify the constituting principles of a design that is
general, performant, and deployable."
