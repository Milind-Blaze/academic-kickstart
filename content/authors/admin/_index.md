I am a second year PhD student at UIUC working with [Prof. Pramod Viswanath](https://web3.princeton.edu/members/). Broadly, I am interested in decentralizing wireless technology and in the plethora of interesting problems surrounding that. This amounts to asking how one can enable the building of wireless, especially cellular, networks bottom up with individuals and small enterprises organically forming and growing the network in an inexpensive manner in the absence of trust. 


I obtained my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras where I worked with [Prof. Radhakrishna Ganti](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~rganti/) at the [Indigenous 5G Testbed](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/5g/).

When I'm not working, I love reading, playing sports and organizing events!
