I recently graduated with a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras and am currently working as a Project Associate at the [Indigenous 5G Testbed](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/5g/) with [Prof. Radhakrishna Ganti](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~rganti/) where, alongside pursuing other projects, I am contributing to the design and development of an end to end 5G compliant system. <!-- I will soon be pursuing graduate studies at UCLA where I am co-advised by [Prof. Suhas Diggavi](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/suhas-diggavi/) and [Prof. Christina Fragouli](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/christina-fragouli/). -->  

Broadly, I am interested in problems in wireless communication and deep learning, especially those lying at the intersection of the two where tools from signal processing and information theory can be used. 

In the past, I have worked with [Prof. Karlheinz Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlheinz_Brandenburg), [Prof. C.S. Ramalingam](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~csr/) and [Prof. Rana Adhikari](https://iqim.caltech.edu/profile/rana-adhikari/). 

When I'm not working, I love reading, playing sports and organizing events!
