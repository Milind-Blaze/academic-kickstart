I am a second year PhD student at UIUC working with [Prof. Brighten Godfrey](https://pbg.cs.illinois.edu/). I am currently interested in the the design of deployable solutions that use virtual channels with disparate properties in wide area and wireless networks to improve application perofrmance.  

I also worked with [Prof. Pramod Viswanath](https://web3.princeton.edu/members/) on decentralizing wireless technology. 
Before this, I obtained my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from IIT Madras where I worked with [Prof. Radhakrishna Ganti](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~rganti/) at the [Indigenous 5G Testbed](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/5g/) and continue to maintain an active interest in 5G technology.

When I'm not working, I love reading, playing sports and organizing events!
