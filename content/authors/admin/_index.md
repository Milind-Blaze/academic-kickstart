I am a senior in the Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras. I will soon be pursuing graduate studies at UCLA where I am co-advised by [Prof. Suhas Diggavi](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/suhas-diggavi/) and [Prof. Christina Fragouli](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/christina-fragouli/). I am fascinated by the application of tools from signal processing, machine learning and information theory especially in domains such as neuroscience. 

In the past I have worked with [Prof. Karlheinz Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlheinz_Brandenburg), [Prof. C.S. Ramalingam](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~csr/) and [Prof. Rana Adhikari](https://iqim.caltech.edu/profile/rana-adhikari/). I am presently working towards my Bachelor's thesis with [Prof. Radha Krishna Ganti](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~rganti/) at the 5G Lab at IIT Madras. 

When I'm not working, I love reading, playing sports and organizing events!
