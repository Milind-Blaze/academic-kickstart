The "Building Flexible, Low-Cost Wireless Access Networks With Magma" paper by the Magma team describes, in some detail, the architectural design principles of Magma and its performance. As a promising open source network core adding new features constantly, it is quite central to the decentralized wireless ecosystem. These summary slides attempt to capture this and position Magma amidst a number of accompanying endeavours- predecessors like CCM and successors like [CellBricks](https://www.shaddih.com/papers/cellbricks-sigcomm21.pdf) and [Witness Chain](https://witnesschain.com/).
